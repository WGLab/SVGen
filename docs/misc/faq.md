1. **How to report a bug or to ask a question?**

    The best way is:
    First, do read the website thoroughly especially FAQ.
    Second, if you cannot find answer in FAQ or do not understand the answer well, then drop me an email as which should contain (1) command line argument (2) error message in screen or the LOG file (3) sometimes example inputfile (4) in case you use Mac or Windows, let me know. The reason is that I can fix something or diagnose something only if I can understand the question and reproduce the results.
